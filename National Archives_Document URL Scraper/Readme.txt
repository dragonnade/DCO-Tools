A script to scrape direct URL links from the National Archives copy of the Planning Inspectorate website, for easier access to documents no longer available on the current PINS website.

Issues:
Identification of uploading party is unreliable.
Filesize is not scraped.
Suffers from the National Archives website throwing a 404 page due to a 403 page when you have looked at more than approx. 8 pages in quick succession.
